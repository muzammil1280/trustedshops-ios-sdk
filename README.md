Integrate our SDK into your shopping app and boost your conversion with **your Trustbadge** and **our buyer protection**:
* Show the Trustbadge in any view and size and provide additional information along with a link to your certificate.
* Integrate the Trusted Shops buyer protection and review collecting services into your app.

## 1. Installation ##

Trustbadge is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Trustbadge", "~> 0.3.4"
```

#### Example project ####
To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first. You can use `pod try Trustbadge` to try out the trustbadge.

## 2. Display the Trustbadge ##

1. Import the header

	```objc
	#import <Trustbadge/Trustbadge.h>
	```

2. Initialize the view with your Trusted Shops ID

	```objc
	TRSTrustbadgeView *myTrustbadgeView = [[TRSTrustbadgeView alloc] initWithTrustedShopsID:@"YOUR-TRUSTED-SHOPS-ID" apiToken:@"THIS-IS-NOT-NEEDED-ATM"];
	```
	
	In order to get your Trusted Shops ID authorized please see the "Authorization" section below.

3. Load the trustbadge data from our backend to properly display the view.

	```objc
	[myTrustbadgeView loadTrustbadgeWithFailureBlock:nil];
	```
	or
	```objc
	[myTrustbadgeView loadTrustbadgeWithSuccessBlock:nil failureBlock:nil];
	```

You may provide blocks that are called on success and/or failure (the failure block expects an `NSError` parameter).
You can also specify a `UIColor` to customize the appearance of the trustcard that is displayed when the user taps on the trustbadge.
By default the trustbadge relies on your application's root `UIViewController` to modally display the information about your certificate. To change that set the `trustcardPresentingViewController` to a different `UIViewController`.

The trustbadge also has a `debugMode` property that, if set to `YES`, makes it load data from the Trusted Shops development API instead of the production API (the above example TS-ID works for debug and normal mode). Note that your shop's TS-ID might not be present on this API, if you need to debug with your own shop's TS-ID please contact Trusted Shops (see below).

## 3. After Checkout Process

As of version 0.3.0 the SDK supports a checkout process for purchases consumers make with your app. This means you can allow them to additionally purchase a guarantee for their order from Trusted Shops, like they know it from many webshops that provide this.
Consumers will then also reminded to give reviews (if you consume this service from Trusted Shops).
To use this feature your app needs to add a few lines of code right after your checkout process:

```objc
	// create a TRSOrder object
	TRSOrder *anOrder = [TRSOrder 
	     TRSOrderWithTrustedShopsID:@"your TS-ID"                     // your TS-ID
	                       apiToken:@"any string for now"             // just use any non-nil, non-empty string
	                          email:@"customer@example.com"           // your customer's email
	                        ordernr:@"0815XYZ"                        // a unique identifier for the order
	                         amount:[NSNumber numberWithDouble:28.73] // the total price as NSNumber
	                           curr:@"EUR"                            // the currency, see documentation for valid values
	                    paymentType:@"PREPAYMENT"                     // see documentation for valid values
	                   deliveryDate:nil];                             // this field is optional
	                   
	// optionally specify the products your customer bought
	TRSProduct *aProduct = [[TRSProduct alloc] 
	      initWithUrl:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.example.com"]
	             name:@"The product's name" 
	              SKU:@"a valid SKU identifier"];
	anOrder.tsCheckoutProductItems = @[aProduct];
	anOrder.debugMode = YES; // see below for information on this! 
	
	// Send the order data to Trusted Shops
	// This will display a (modal) webView that displays content based on the services you bought from Trusted Shops.
	// E.g., it will display a window to allow the user to purchase a guarantee. Users can always just dismiss it, of course.
	[anOrder finishWithCompletionBlock:^(NSError *error) {
	    // handle errors and/or further process the order accoding to your app's needs
	};
```
	
For a more detailed description of the methods and objects handling this process, see the SDK documentation.
Please be aware that in some use-cases the user may be referred to an external (mobile) website opening on Safari (for example if this is the first time they purchase a Trusted Shops guarantee). The modal WebView closes in these instances, so once they get back they can keep on using your app as usual. Like is the case with the `TRSTrustbadgeView`, you can specify a `customPresentingViewController` object to manage the presentation of the displayed dialogue boxes during the finish process.

If you are developing your application and want to test this SDK feature __please be aware that unless the order object's `debugMode` property is set to `YES`, the generated data is sent to the Trusted Shops production database!__
