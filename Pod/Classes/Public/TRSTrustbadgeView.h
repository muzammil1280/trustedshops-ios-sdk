/** 
 `TRSTrustbadgeView` is a subclass of `UIView` for displaying a trustmark in your application
 that can show a floating lightbox with the trustcard information of your Trusted Shops certificate.
 
 After initializing the view, you need to load the certificate data from the Trusted SHops API
 by calling `loadTrustbadgeWithFailureBlock:` or `loadTrustbadgeWithSuccessBlock:failureBlock:`
 for the view to actually display anything. Not doing so results in an empty view.
 
 The lightbox is modally presented by your application's root `UIViewController` object by default.
 Should this lead to unwanted behavior (the box showing up behind your own modally presented view,
 for example) you can set a different view controller for the presentation by setting the
 `trustcardPresentingViewController` property.
